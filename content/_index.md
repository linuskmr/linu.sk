Hey, I'm Linus. I have been fascinated by computers and programming languages since learning Python 2 as a child. Since then I came across various programming languages, with Rust being my current favorite. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of operating systems and low-level systems programming using modern programming languages, computer networking as well as applied cybersecurity.
