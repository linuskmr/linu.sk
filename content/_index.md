Hey, I'm Linus. I have been fascinated by computers and programming languages since learning Python 2 as a child. Since then I came across various programming languages. Currently, I mostly work with Rust, Go and C/C++ as well as Python and Javascript/Typescript.
My area of interest lies in the intersection of operating systems and low-level systems programming, modern programming languages (Rust and Go), networking as well as applied cybersecurity.
